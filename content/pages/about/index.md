## 👋 Hello!

**Moaz | Technical Co-Founder & Aspiring CTO | Cloud Architect & DevOps Engineer | KFUPM Computer Engineering**

A strategic Computer Engineering Senior at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), focused on architecting and deploying scalable software solutions. I thrive at the critical intersection of application development and robust infrastructure.

My expertise is split across the full delivery pipeline:

- **Cloud & DevOps**: Specialized in Cloud Computing (AWS, GCP), IT Infrastructure, and DevOps principles. I leverage tools like Linux and CI/CD to automate systems, ensuring scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency. My current focus is advancing skills in MLOps and pursuing professional certifications (starting with the AWS CCP).

- **Web Development**: Experienced in the modern stack, including React, NextJS, and backend development using Django & Python. I possess the unique ability to build the application and engineer the robust systems it runs on.

- **Entrepreneurship**: As a Technical Partner and aspiring CTO for Chapter-14, I am leading the technical vision for an innovative ed-tech platform that leverages AI features to enhance academic success for university students. I am deeply invested in the business side of technology, covering finance and startup growth.

I am driven by a passion for continuous learning and a commitment to transforming complex technical challenges into simplified, high-impact products.
